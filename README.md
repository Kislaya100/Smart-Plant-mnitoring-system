# Smart-Plant-mnitoring-system
This project is my first project on Internet of Things, in which I have used BOLT cloud platform which is a wifi module integrated with Light Detecting Resistor(LDR) and this LDR is placed alongwith the plant which will give the detail of the luminious intensity of the light falling on the plant.
